_Note: Thanks for all the recent feedback! Please don't take any of this too
seriously right now. Use this repo to bounce ideas and share novel ways people
are solving established problems._

A [wigwam](https://taylor.town/pardon-2023#wigwams) is a project that reduces
reliance on [battleships](https://taylor.town/pardon-2023#wigwams).

More specifically, a wigwam is a reasonably-established project that provides
alternatives to bloat/cruft.

Remember, wigwams aren't better than battleships -- they're not even boats!
Let's celebrate novelty and learn to build together.

Wigwams we want:

- affordable DIY motor vehicles
- a dirt-simple OS for practical use [and reuse](https://permacomputing.net)
- tools/guides for "kit" homes that can be constructed from nearby materials,
  e.g. how to clear patch of forest and build cabin with lumber
- a simple alternative to github, and maybe even git
- tools for converting suburban sprawl into human-scale walkable infrastructure
- simple/predictable query languages and databases
  ([email Taylor](mailto:hello@taylor.town) for ideas)
- a simple, open search engine
- scalable diy paper production and printing presses
- expressive but small visual markup languages
- kits/guides for making everyday clothes out of fabric and scraps
- alternative to YouTube that smells more like podcasts than cryptocurrency
  ([email Taylor](mailto:hello@taylor.town) for ideas)
