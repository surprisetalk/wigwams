Wigwams we want:

- a dirt-simple OS for practical use [and reuse](https://permacomputing.net)
- tools/guides for "kit" homes that can be constructed from nearby materials,
  e.g. how to clear patch of forest and build cabin with lumber
- a simple alternative to github, and maybe even git
- simple/predictable query languages and databases
  ([email me](mailto:hello@taylor.town) for ideas)
- scalable diy paper production and printing presses
- expressive but small visual markup languages
- kits/guides for making everyday clothes out of fabric and scraps
- alternative to YouTube that smells more like podcasts than cryptocurrency
  ([email me](mailto:hello@taylor.town) for ideas)
